Used Tensorflow library functions for convolutional layers and numpy and pandas for data preprocessing. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.5% with 5 epocs. Looked through various cases of under and over fitting models and evaluated their performance. Achieved an accuracy of 96% with 25 epochs ( which is significantly lower than that of 5 epochs ), thus indication overfitting.
